description: The Bunner Sisters (1892) takes place in a shabby neighborhood in New
  York City. The two Bunner sisters, Ann Eliza the elder, and Evelina the younger,
  keep a small shop selling artificial flowers and small handsewn articles to Stuyvesant
  Square's 'female population'. Ann Eliza gives Evelina a clock for her birthday.
  The clock leads the sisters to become involved with Herbert Ramy, owner of 'the
  queerest little store you ever laid eyes on'. Soon Ramy is a regular guest of the
  Bunner sisters, who realize that their 'treadmill routine', once so comfortable,
  is now 'intolerably monotonous'.
